        <p>Taking the edX course Pre-University Chemistry was an enriching and comprehensive experience that strengthened my foundation in chemistry while connecting scientific principles to real-world and emerging applications. The course was divided into three major sections: Energy Transition, Chemistry of Health, and New Materials. Each part deepened my understanding of different chemical concepts and their relevance to both academic and practical contexts.</p>
<p>The first section, Energy Transition, focused on fundamental chemical theories such as atomic structure, redox reactions, and chemical equilibrium. Although these topics were partly familiar from my previous A-level studies, the course presented them from a more analytical perspective. I particularly enjoyed revisiting redox reactions, where I could better appreciate how electron transfer governs both simple and complex systems — from batteries to biological metabolism. The discussion on chemical equilibrium also provided a bridge between theory and experiment, helping me understand how microscopic dynamics determine macroscopic stability. This section not only consolidated my knowledge but also prepared me for deeper study in physical and inorganic chemistry at the university level.</p>
<p>The second section, Chemistry of Health, was especially engaging because it explored the chemical foundations of biological systems. I learned how acid-base balance maintains homeostasis in the human body and how intermolecular forces control the transport and interaction of biomolecules. The exploration of biomolecules and macromolecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, offered a fascinating intersection of chemistry and life sciences. It allowed me to see how molecular structure determines function, and how subtle changes in chemistry can lead to profound biological effects. This section reminded me that chemistry is not isolated from life—it is the language through which biological systems operate.</p>
<p>The final section, New Materials, introduced me to areas of chemistry that are increasingly relevant in modern technology. I learned about the properties of solids, metals, and the mechanisms underlying electrochemical reactions. The discussion of electrochemistry helped me connect earlier concepts of redox reactions with practical applications such as fuel cells, corrosion prevention, and energy storage. The introduction to nanochemistry was particularly inspiring; it showed how the manipulation of matter at the nanoscale opens new possibilities in materials science, medicine, and environmental protection. Understanding how atomic structure translates into macroscopic properties made me appreciate the creativity involved in designing new materials.</p>
<p>Pre-University Chemistry not only reinforced my theoretical background but also expanded my vision of chemistry. It strengthened my analytical thinking and experimental reasoning. Completing this course has deepened my enthusiasm for pursuing further studies in chemistry and related disciplines such as conservation science and materials research.</p>

        <p>organized by the Nanjing Foreign Language School and the Da Bao en<br>Temple Site Museum I participated in a collaborative museum studies program jointly organized by the Nanjing Foreign Language School and the Da Bao en Temple Site Museum. The program integrated cultural heritage studies with material science and chemistry, offering an in-depth exploration of how modern scientific methods can be applied to the preservation, analysis, and restoration of ancient artifacts and architectural remains. It was divided into three main components: on-site archaeological fieldwork, curatorial and materials study, and an independent research project.<br><img src="/./Museum-lesson/brochure%20of%20the%20programme.jpg" alt="brochure of the programme"></p>
<p>During the fieldwork module, I visited the Zhang Zhao Tomb and the ruins of the ancient Changgan City. Through these visits, I was introduced to various scientific techniques used in archaeological investigation, such as radiocarbon dating (C-14 analysis) for chronological determination and spectroscopic methods (including infrared and UV visible spectroscopy) for analyzing material composition. I was particularly fascinated by how chemistry provides a bridge between the tangible relics of the past and our scientific understanding of time and process. For example, learning about the role of isotopic decay in carbon dating gave me a new appreciation of how fundamental chemical principles half-life, isotopic ratios, and radioactive equilibrium can literally measure time in the archaeological record.</p>
<p>The second part of the program focused on the Da Bao en Temple Site Museum itself, where we studied both the artifacts and the unique architectural techniques employed in the temple’s reconstruction and preservation. We explored the ancient Chinese art of glazed tile and colored glass production, investigating how materials science explains the distinctive properties of these historical materials. From a chemical standpoint, I learned that ancient liuli (glazed glass) differs from modern glass primarily in composition and microstructure. Ancient liuli typically contains high lead oxide and low silica content, which enhances its refractive index and color brilliance but also increases its fragility and susceptibility to corrosion.</p>
<p>We also analyzed the chemical processes involved in the production of colored glazes, such as the use of metal oxides (e.g., Cu²⁺ for green-blue, Fe³⁺ for amber tones, and Co²⁺ for deep blue). Understanding the redox reactions that influence color formation helped me see how chemistry not only enables the creation of beauty but also governs its preservation. Moreover, by studying the differences between glass and liuli in terms of ionic mobility, crystallinity, and resistance to weathering, I gained a better sense of why some ancient artifacts retain their brilliance over millennia while others deteriorate rapidly.</p>
<p>In the laboratory component, we learned about the chemical conservation and restoration of artifacts. I had the opportunity to synthesize and decompose basic copper carbonate (Cu₂(OH)₂CO₃), a key compound in patinas and a product of copper corrosion, to understand both degradation mechanisms and potential restoration approaches. By comparing synthetic and naturally weathered samples under controlled conditions, I could observe how pH, humidity, and temperature influence the stability of carbonate layers. These experiments deepened my understanding of how chemical equilibrium and solubility product (Ksp) play critical roles in the long-term preservation of metal-based artifacts.</p>
<p>The final stage of the program was a self-directed research project, where I chose to investigate the application of glass–ceramic composite materials in the restoration of liuli architectural elements. My research aimed to explore how modern material synthesis techniques could address the limitations of traditional liuli, such as fragility and poor weather resistance, while preserving its aesthetic and historical authenticity. I examined the controlled crystallization process in glass–ceramics, focusing on the role of nucleating agents (like TiO₂ and ZrO₂) in promoting uniform crystal growth within a glass matrix. This balance between amorphous and crystalline phases offers improved mechanical strength and durability—properties essential for outdoor architectural restoration.</p>
<p>To support this study, I reviewed both historical literature and recent research on solid-state reactions, ion diffusion, and microstructure-property relationships in glass–ceramic systems. I also compared thermal and optical properties of different silicate-based composites, analyzing how factors like melting temperature, refractive index, and expansion coefficient could be optimized to achieve compatibility with ancient liuli. This independent project not only enhanced my ability to connect chemical principles to real-world cultural heritage applications but also trained me in basic academic research methods—structuring a hypothesis, reviewing literature, and organizing technical information into a coherent scientific argument.</p>
<p>Beyond the scientific knowledge, the program gave me a profound sense of the interdisciplinary power of chemistry. It demonstrated how molecular understanding can inform fields as diverse as art history, archaeology, and architecture. Standing in front of centuries-old relics, I realized that preserving them is not only an act of cultural respect but also a chemical challenge—a test of how well we understand materials, reactions, and the passage of time.</p>
<p>Overall, this museum program helped me integrate my interests in chemistry and cultural heritage. It strengthened my scientific foundation in material chemistry while cultivating a more humanistic perspective on science as a means of preservation rather than exploitation. The experience convinced me that the future of heritage conservation lies in collaboration between scientists and historians, and it inspired me to continue exploring how chemical innovation can protect and revitalize the legacy of the past.</p>

        <p>During my self-directed study on edX, I completed the university-level course Science in Art: The Chemistry of Art Materials and Conservation. This experience allowed me to explore how chemistry underlies the creation, transformation, and preservation of artworks. It not only deepened my understanding of chemical principles but also strengthened my appreciation for the scientific foundation of cultural heritage conservation.</p>
<p>The course began with a detailed exploration of oil painting—how pigments are produced, why they display different colors, and how the composition of paint layers affects texture and durability. I learned about the molecular structures of common pigments and how factors such as oxidation, light exposure, and humidity can cause color fading or darkening over time. Understanding these reactions made me realize that the beauty of a painting depends not only on artistic creativity but also on the stability of its chemical composition. I also studied how different binders and varnishes interact with pigments to form layers that influence gloss, transparency, and long-term preservation.</p>
<p>Next, the course introduced the chemistry of ceramics and porcelain. I examined how variations in raw materials and firing temperatures determine the color, hardness, and translucency of porcelain. Through studying the chemical reactions involved in the firing process—such as the transformation of kaolinite into mullite—I gained insight into how ancient craftsmen achieved both functionality and aesthetics. It was fascinating to see how precise chemical control translates into artistic expression and how deterioration mechanisms like glaze cracking can be explained by material science.</p>
<p>In the final section, I explored the conservation of different art materials. Topics included environmental control, cleaning methods, and preventive measures that slow chemical degradation.</p>
<p>Through this learning experience, I came to appreciate how closely art and science are intertwined. Chemistry is not only a tool for creating new materials but also a key to understanding the past and protecting cultural heritage for the future. This course inspired me to pursue further studies in conservation science and to consider how interdisciplinary approaches can bridge creativity and analytical reasoning—skills that I believe are essential for my future in cultural heritage preservation.</p>

        <p>From March 22nd, 2025, I participated in a seven-week Youth Scientific Research Program focused on Toxicology and Drug Metabolism. This project provided me with an in-depth understanding of how chemical structure determines biological function and pharmacological effects, bridging my knowledge of chemistry with human physiology.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, we explored the molecular structures and reaction mechanisms of various drugs, studying how they interact with biological membranes and cellular systems. Topics such as how aspirin reduces fever and why colchicine can be toxic helped me understand how small structural changes in molecules can lead to vastly different biological outcomes. These discussions deepened my appreciation for the chemical principles underlying drug design—how properties like polarity, solubility, and functional groups affect a compound’s activity and metabolism.</p>
<p>A highlight of the program was our group research paper, titled “The Influence Mechanism and Treatment Methods of Glutathione Level in Reducing ASD.” In this project, I was responsible for the drug chemistry mechanisms and clinical data analysis sections. I led my team in developing the research topic and paper structure, assigning tasks according to each member’s strengths, and ensuring the overall coherence of our work. This experience improved my scientific communication and leadership skills, as I learned to integrate diverse perspectives into a unified research direction.</p>
<p>Through my part of the project, I gained experience in interpreting chemical structures from academic literature, analyzing how molecular properties relate to biological activity. I also strengthened my ability to handle quantitative data, using statistical tools to evaluate experimental and clinical findings. Working with real biomedical data showed me how chemistry, biology, and medicine converge in modern research, and how critical accurate data interpretation is for drawing reliable conclusions.</p>
<p>Beyond technical skills, this project also transformed the way I think about chemistry. I came to see it not only as a study of substances and reactions but also as a key to understanding life processes at the molecular level. Drug metabolism, for example, illustrates how chemical reactivity directly influences health outcomes—a connection that fascinated me and inspired me to continue exploring biochemical research.</p>
<p>Overall, the Youth Scientific Research Program was a milestone in my academic growth. It deepened my understanding of applied chemistry in medicine, taught me how to conduct and present research systematically, and allowed me to develop as both a scientist and a collaborator. The project’s interdisciplinary nature—linking chemistry,pharmacology, and data science—showed me how integrated thinking can lead to innovation. More importantly, it reinforced my motivation to pursue future studies in biochemical research and drug development, where chemistry serves not just as a subject of study, but as a tool for improving human life.</p>

        <p>From late 2024 to January 24th, 2025, I dedicated myself to preparing for the UK Chemistry Olympiad (UKCHO). The preparation process not only deepened my understanding of organic and inorganic principles but also honed my ability to think logically, creatively, and independently.</p>
<p>Through constant practice, I developed a strong ability to identify the characteristics of functional groups and predict reaction mechanisms using logic and pattern recognition. I learned to recognize recurring structural motifs, electron flow tendencies, and reaction intermediates. Rather than memorizing every transformation, I focused on understanding the reasoning behind them—how molecular structure determines reactivity and how electronic effects guide reaction pathways. This approach allowed me to derive reaction outcomes through deduction rather than recall. I believe this ability to reason through unfamiliar situations and intuitively predict chemical behavior will be essential in my future studies and research, especially when dealing with unknown compounds or designing new synthetic routes.</p>
<p>During my preparation, I often encountered past paper questions involving unfamiliar substances or reactions, sometimes even containing functional groups I had never learned before. Initially, this was frustrating, as the Olympiad’s level far exceeded standard curriculum content. However, over time I realized that each unfamiliar question was an opportunity to test my conceptual flexibility. By analyzing known functional groups and recalling reaction patterns from previous problems, I learned to use analogy and chemical reasoning to predict plausible outcomes. For instance, when presented with an unknown compound, I would first identify its electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents, infer its likely reactivity, and then relate it to similar mechanisms I had studied earlier. This analytical process trained my ability to extrapolate from first principles—a skill central to advanced chemical research.</p>
<p>Beyond problem-solving, preparing for the UKCHO also improved my exam strategy and discipline. Each past paper required not only technical knowledge but also time management and precision in calculation. I learned to organize my work systematically, balance qualitative reasoning with quantitative accuracy, and communicate my logic clearly through chemical equations and mechanisms. These habits have strengthened my scientific mindset: careful, structured, and driven by understanding rather than memorization.</p>
<p>Most importantly, this preparation experience changed how I perceive chemistry as a discipline. I came to appreciate chemistry not as a collection of isolated reactions, but as a coherent system governed by logical principles and energetic constraints. It is a language of patterns—where recognizing underlying relationships allows one to navigate even the most complex problems.</p>

        <p>In August 2024, I participated in the Harvard Undergraduate Auscr Summit for Young Leaders in China (HSYLC), where I enrolled in three elective courses. Among them, the most memorable was “Regression Curve Prediction,” a course focused on the fundamentals of statistical analysis. I learned how to apply regression models to identify relationships between variables, use Excel to organize and calculate correlation data, and visualize results through regression curve plotting. I chose this course because I believed that statistical tools are highly applicable to analyzing experimental data in chemistry research.</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, I also participated in the Capstone Project, where my group presented our findings through a poster and oral presentation.This experience taught me how to communicate complex data clearly and collaborate effectively in an academic environment.</p>
<p>Through HSYLC, I not only strengthened my understanding of mathematics,<br>statistics, and chemistry, but also developed a more interdisciplinary<br>perspective. It inspired me to integrate quantitative reasoning into<br>scientific inquiry and deepened my interest in combining data analysis<br>with experimental science.</p>

        <p>In July 2024, I attended the University College London (UCL) Online Summer School, which focused on the theme of reducing carbon emissionsand mitigating global warming. The program was highly interdisciplinary, combining elements of chemistry, environmental science, and engineering to explore how scientific innovation can address climate change.</p>
<p>Among the many lectures and discussions, the sessions that impressed me most were those examining the chemical properties of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄), and how modifications in chemical processes can help reduce their emissions. For example, I learned how improving catalytic efficiency and developing sustainable industrial reactions can lower CO₂ output in energy production and manufacturing. These topics deepened my understanding of the chemical foundations of climate change and showed me how theoretical chemistry can be transformed into practical environmental solutions.</p>
<p>One of the most valuable aspects of the program was my first experience with academic research and scientific writing. Our final assignment required us to produce a review paper on global warming, which introduced me to literature searching, citation practices, and academic structure. I learned how to use keywords effectively to locate relevant journal articles, evaluate their reliability, and summarize findings systematically. Although it was challenging at first, this process helped me develop critical reading and writing skills essential for future scientific research.</p>
<p>The summer school also emphasized the importance of collaboration and communication in science. Through group discussions and online presentations, I had the opportunity to exchange ideas with students from different academic and cultural backgrounds. These interactions broadened my perspective and helped me understand how global cooperation is essential in addressing environmental challenges. I also gained confidence in expressing my ideas clearly in English, especially when discussing complex scientific concepts.</p>
<p>Through this program, I developed not only academic knowledge but also the mindset of a researcher—curious, analytical, and determined to apply science for the greater good. The experience reaffirmed my aspiration to study and work at the intersection of chemistry and environmental innovation, where I can contribute to creating a cleaner, more sustainable world.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>From January to April 2024, I dedicated myself to preparing for the British Biology Olympiad (BBO), culminating in the examination on April 6th. During these four months of intensive study, I not only deepened my understanding of biological concepts but also developed a new way of thinking—approaching the world through the logical and systematic lens of biology.</p>
<p>The most valuable lesson I learned from preparing for the BBO was how biology provides a rational and evidence-based framework for understanding the world. Through studying topics such as natural selection, enzyme kinetics, and population dynamics, I realized that biological phenomena are not random, but governed by patterns that can be observed, tested, and explained. For instance, learning about feedback regulation in homeostasis helped me see how living organisms maintain internal balance through precise molecular control, just as ecosystems maintain stability through interdependent relationships. Similarly, studying Mendelian genetics and evolutionary mechanisms allowed me to appreciate how diversity in life results from small, predictable changes accumulating over time. This logical and structured way of thinking—identifying mechanisms, analyzing variables, and tracing causality—has influenced how I view not just biology, but the entire<br>natural world.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of my preparation involved integrating knowledge from chemistry to better understand biological processes. When reviewing molecular biology and biochemistry sections, I found that concepts like DNA structure, protein folding, and enzyme catalysis all rely heavily on chemical principles. For example, understanding how the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of amino acids affect protein structure helped me connect molecular interactions with larger biological functions. Likewise, learning about hydrogen bonding and base-pairing in DNA revealed how chemistry governs the storage and transmission of genetic information. These insights made me realize that biology and chemistry are deeply interconnected—biology describes <em>what</em> happens in living systems, while chemistry explains <em>how</em> it happens.</p>
<p>Beyond academic knowledge, preparing for the BBO trained my persistence and analytical thinking. The process demanded extensive reading, problem-solving, and the ability to synthesize information from different branches of biology—ecology, physiology, biochemistry, and genetics. There were times when the complexity felt overwhelming, but every challenge strengthened my curiosity and confidence in scientific inquiry. I learned to approach each question not by memorizing facts, but by reasoning through mechanisms and applying cross-disciplinary logic.</p>
<p>For the finial result, I got global silver. It was a little bit upset, but I would inspire myself to prepare for BBO more carefully and wisely, in order to get process in the next-year’s exam.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>From April 4th to 6th, 2024, I participated in OXMUN, the Oxford Model<br>United Nations conference held in Shanghai. I represented India in the UN Women committee, where our discussions centered on violence against women in workplaces and public spaces. Although I did not receive an award, this experience was deeply meaningful and provided me with valuable insights into international dialogue, gender issues, and personal growth.</p>
<p>One of the first things I noticed at the conference was the diversity and sophistication of the delegates. Many participants came from international schools in Shanghai, and compared to them, I immediately felt the difference in background and exposure. They spoke English fluently and naturally, were well-versed in international affairs, and had access to global learning opportunities such as exchange programsand political science electives. As a student from a second-tier city, I initially felt self-conscious about my comparatively limited experience and less polished communication.</p>
<p>However, this feeling gradually transformed into self-awareness and confidence. Through conversations with other delegates, I realized that while I might lack certain advantages in language or global exposure, I possessed other strengths that were equally important—creativity, practical reasoning, and sensitivity to local realities. These qualities became especially valuable during our debates, where we discussed how to combat gender-based violence in developing regions.</p>
<p>Drawing on my understanding of social and economic disparities, I proposed an initiative to establish women-centered companies in underdeveloped areas, built upon local industries and resources. Such companies would serve two key purposes: first, to help women achieve economic independence by providing stable employment, and second, to educate women about their rights and self-protection. This approach focused not just on external aid but on creating sustainable, community-driven change. My proposal sparked enthusiastic discussion among delegates and was eventually incorporated into the final resolution—a moment that filled me with pride and reaffirmed the value of thinking from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>Beyond policy discussions, OXMUN also taught me how to find my place in a highly competitive environment. I learned that diplomacy is not only about eloquence or confidence, but also about observation, empathy, and the courage to share ideas that matter. Instead of comparing myself to others, I began to appreciate what I could contribute—a grounded understanding of feasibility and innovation rooted in real-world context.</p>
<p>In the end, OXMUN 2024 became an experience of self-discovery. It broadened my global awareness, strengthened my communication skills, and encouraged me to view challenges as opportunities to learn rather than limitations. More importantly, it reminded me that meaningful participation in global dialogue comes not from where one begins, but from how one thinks, learns, and acts to make a difference.</p>
