        <p>In the March of 2024, I participated in the 35th National Youth Science and Technology Innovation Competition with my research project titled<br><em>“Promoting Low-Carbon Campuses through a Water-Source Heat Pump District Cooling and Heating System under the Dual-Carbon Strategy.”</em> This experience marked one of the most meaningful stages in my academic journey, as it allowed me to apply scientific thinking to real-world sustainability issues while developing technical, analytical, and communication skills.</p>
<p>The core of my research was to explore how new energy systems could replace traditional air-conditioning refrigerants such as Freon, which are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. By investigating the potential of a water-source heat pump system that utilizes river water as a thermal reservoir, I examined how renewable thermal energy could be integrated into campus-scale cooling and heating. To support my analysis, I used <strong>OpenStudio</strong>, an energy modeling software, to simulate the system’s performance and estimate the potential reduction in carbon emissions when applied to a school environment. Through these simulations, I learned to quantify how sustainable technologies can contribute to China’s dual-carbon goals—carbon peaking and carbon neutrality.</p>
<p>Throughout the research process, I gained valuable experience in using modeling tools and data-driven approaches to evaluate energy systems.Before this project, I had limited knowledge of energy modeling, but learning to operate OpenStudio taught me how to translate real-world conditions into computational models. I discovered the importance of setting appropriate parameters, validating assumptions, and interpreting data critically. More importantly, I realized that scientific innovation is not only about generating new ideas but also about supporting them with clear evidence and quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>Another significant part of the competition was the final defense session. Presenting my research to the judges and experts helped me improve my ability to communicate complex scientific ideas in a clear and accessible way. I learned to organize my arguments logically, highlight key findings effectively, and respond to questions with confidence. This process taught me how to bridge the gap between technical research and public understanding—a skill essential for future scientists and innovators.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my project was awarded the First Prize at the Jiangsu Provincial Level, which was both an honor and a motivation for me to continue exploring sustainable technologies. Beyond the recognition, the experience reinforced my belief in the importance of interdisciplinary learning. By combining principles from environmental science, thermodynamics, and data modeling, I discovered how engineering innovation can contribute to solving urgent environmental challenges.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>From February 3rd to 7th, 2024, I participated in the Security Council<br>of NK24 Model United Nations, representing Israel in discussions centered on the Israel–Palestine conflict. It was my first time to attend a model UN conference, and I recieved the Nobel Delegate Prize. This experience was both intellectually challenging and personally transformative. It not only deepened my understanding of international relations but also allowed me to strengthen my communication, critical thinking, and diplomatic skills.</p>
<p>Representing Israel forced me to step outside my own perspective and view global issues from a position that is often controversial and complex. At first, it was difficult to justify certain policies or defend Israel’s actions in ongoing conflicts. However, through researching Israel’s historical background, security concerns, and political motivations, I began to understand how each decision is shaped by national interests and the pursuit of survival in a volatile region. This role helped me recognize that in international affairs, there is rarely absolute right or wrong—only competing priorities and perspectives. It also made me realize that war, while tragic, often persists because of the strategic benefits and political calculations behind it. Understanding this uncomfortable truth was one of the most valuable lessons I took away from the conference.</p>
<p>Moreover, participating in debates and negotiations significantly improved my English speaking and debating skills. The sessions were intense and fast-paced, requiring quick thinking, precise articulation, and persuasive argumentation. I learned how to construct logical arguments under pressure, respond confidently to counterpoints, and use formal diplomatic language effectively. Engaging with delegates from diverse backgrounds also exposed me to different rhetorical styles and negotiation techniques, which helped me refine my own communication approach.</p>
<p>Equally important was the experience of collaboration. While each delegate represented a nation with its own stance, meaningful resolutions could only emerge through compromise and cooperation. I learned how to engage in constructive dialogue—listening to opposing views, finding common ground, and building alliances that could lead to consensus. Working with delegates whose positions differed sharply from mine taught me patience, flexibility, and empathy. It showed me that diplomacy is not about overpowering others with arguments, but about balancing interests and fostering mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Overall, NK24 MUN was far more than a simulation—it was a microcosm of<br>real-world international politics. Through this experience, I gained a clearer picture of how global conflicts are shaped, debated, and sometimes resolved. I left the conference not only with stronger communication skills but also with a more nuanced worldview and a deeper appreciation for the complexities of peace and diplomacy. This experience has inspired me to continue exploring international relations, and to approach future challenges with both rational analysis and an open mind.</p>
